## :cow: Hi there! You've found @Zelon88's Github Page!

I develop open-source software by the seat of my pants for pleasure and for business. My code tends to have a visceral feel to it but it gets the job done. 

I am driven by a desire to not rely on proprietary software or third party services to accomplish my goals. My projects emphasize security, privacy, & self-hosted alternatives to popular Cloud services.
