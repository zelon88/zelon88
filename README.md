## :cow: Hi there! You've found @Zelon88's Github Page!

I develop open-source software for pleasure and for business. I am available for hire on a contractual basis for a variety of work including (but not limited to):

* Full Stack Web Application Development
* Process Automation
* Special Projects
* Domain, Network, Database & Systems Administration
* Consulting

My projects emphasize security, privacy, & self-hosted alternatives to popular Cloud services. I am driven by a desire to not rely on proprietary software or third party services to accomplish my goals.
