## :cow: Hi there! You've found @Zelon88's Github Page!

By day I work as a Director of Information Technology in the hospitality industry. By night I develop open-source software for pleasure and for business. 

My projects emphasize security, privacy, & self-hosted alternatives to popular Cloud services. I am driven by a desire to not rely on proprietary software or third party services to accomplish my goals.
